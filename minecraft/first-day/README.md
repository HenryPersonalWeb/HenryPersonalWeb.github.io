## Step1: Craft the logs into planks!
### Press "E" to open your inventory (The button could be changed).
### Put your logs into the right upper slots shown. 
### Then click the planks
### As a little trick, you can shift+click the planks to craft the maximum amount of planks!
## You can then make a crafting table using the formula shown!
## Step 2: Craft a wooden pickaxe!

### All types of planks could be used
## Step 3: Mine some stone (20 is enough)!
### You can find stone in exposed caves, or you can dig straight down (beware the caves)  to mine stone!
### ![Stone](https://henrypersonalweb.github.io/minecraft/first-day/stone.webp)
##### Stones should look like this
### You will get cobblestones as a result (assuming you don't have a silk touch pickaxe)!
### ![Stone](https://henrypersonalweb.github.io/minecraft/first-day/cobblestone.webp)
##### Cobblestones should look like this
## Also be careful, don't mine andesites, which look similar to stones!

### After you mined the stones, craft the items below!
#### 1. Stone pickaxe

### Optional: Mine iron
If you want to have armor, then you may want to start mining iron ores using your stone pickaxe.
### ![iron](https://henrypersonalweb.github.io/minecraft/iron- ore.png)
##### The picture above shows an iron ore and a deepslate iron ore, and mining them will drop a raw iron.

##### The picture above shows a raw iron.
### The next step is to smelt the raw iron in a furnace

### Next, you can craft the iron ingots into the things you want. Like iron armor.
