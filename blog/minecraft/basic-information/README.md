# Basic Information about Minecraft Worlds!
## 1. Seed
## A world's seed can be automatically generated when a world is created, but it can also be set manually in "More World Options"
## Each seed will generate the same structures in the same coordinates. 
## You can check out your seed by using this command <code>/seed<code/>
## You can check out the structures of each seed [here](https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map)!
## 2. Chunk
## A chunk is a 16*384*16 area made up of blocks. 
## You can see the borders of each other using F3+G, and knowing the borders of chunks can be useful in many cases, such as building slime farms.
