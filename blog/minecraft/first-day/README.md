## Step1: Craft the logs into planks!
### Press "E" to open your inventory (The button could be changed).
### Put your logs into the right upper slots shown. 
### Then click the planks
### As a little trick, you can shift+click the planks to craft the maximum amount of planks!
## You can then make a crafting table using the formula shown!
## Step 2: Craft a wooden pickaxe!
